### 🧱 1. **Structure and Separation of Concerns**

* **Suggestion:** Consider separating your form sections using semantic HTML elements (`<form>`, `<fieldset>`, etc.) rather than a `<table>`.
* **Benefit:** Improves accessibility, readability, and is more semantically correct. Tables are intended for tabular data, not layout.

---

### 🧩 2. **Event Handling**

* **Suggestion:** Instead of using inline `onclick` handlers (e.g., `onclick="getBalance()"`), bind your events via JavaScript.
* **Benefit:** Keeps HTML clean and separates logic from structure, making it easier to debug and scale.

---

### ♻️ 3. **Code Reuse**

* **Suggestion:** If your JavaScript has repeated logic for reading inputs or rendering rows, consider using helper functions or modular patterns.
* **Benefit:** Reduces duplication, enhances maintainability, and makes testing easier.

---

### 🔄 4. **State Management**

* **Suggestion:** If you're keeping a list of bills/expenses/income in memory, consider using a single array or object to store and classify all transactions.
* **Benefit:** Makes it easier to calculate totals, update entries, and persist to localStorage later.

---

### ⚖️ 5. **Conditional Logic**

* **Suggestion:** If your script uses a long `if/else` chain to distinguish between income, bills, and expenses, consider using a `switch` statement or a mapping object instead.
* **Benefit:** Cleaner logic, easier to add new types later, and avoids deeply nested code.

---

### 🧪 6. **Validation**

* **Suggestion:** Ensure you're validating inputs in your JavaScript (e.g., prevent empty or zero-value entries).
* **Benefit:** Prevents incorrect data and improves user experience.

---

### 🧠 7. **Accessibility & Feedback**

* **Suggestion:** Provide user feedback on successful entry or input errors (e.g., small messages next to fields or alerts).
* **Benefit:** Better user experience, and makes the app feel more polished.

---

### 💾 8. **Future-Proofing**

* **Suggestion:** Think about adding localStorage integration once your transaction data structure is solid.
* **Benefit:** Makes your app persistent across sessions, adding real-world utility.

🧾 ToDo Review:
✅ 1. Structure and Separation of Concerns
✔ Done. You’re not using tables for layout. Using semantic form structure would be a nice next step, but it’s not misused.

✅ 2. Event Handling
✔ Done. You’re using addEventListener() rather than inline onclick. Clean and scalable.

✅ 3. Code Reuse
➖ Partially Done.
You created a newRow() function, but:

It doesn't take an entry argument.

It accesses entryName, entryValue, etc., directly from the form — not from passed data.

You're still repeating logic (e.g., background coloring, value assignment).

✅ Next step: Refactor newRow() into something like addRow(entry) that takes an entry array and handles row creation independently of form inputs.

✅ 4. State Management
✔ Done. You’re using a single array allEntries to manage all transactions. Good structure.

✅ 5. Conditional Logic
✔ Done. You're using a switch statement for transaction type formatting — perfect fit for your current logic.

✅ 6. Validation
✔ Done. You’re validating that inputs aren't empty before allowing a submission.

💡 Future enhancement: You could validate that the value is a positive number or display friendlier field-level messages.

⚠️ 7. Accessibility & Feedback
➖ Partially Done. You use alerts, which is a start, but no on-screen visual feedback or ARIA-friendly indicators.

✅ Next step: Add a success message or inline error near the form instead of relying on alert().

✅ 8. Future-Proofing / Local Storage
✔ Done. You're using localStorage to persist both entries and balance.

💡 Optional improvement: abstract storage logic into helpers (saveData(), loadData()).

🔍 Filtering Entries Checklist
✅ 1–5: Filter Setup
You’ve:

Added a filter dropdown

Used allEntries as your base

Built filtered arrays

Rendered filtered results

Hooked everything into change events

💯 Great job.

⚠️ 6. Edge Case Testing
Not clearly handled:

What happens if no results match the filter?

Can multiple filters be added later?

✅ Next step: Handle empty result sets with a message like "No results found."

🛠️ Refactor Review
Refactor Task	Status	Notes
renderTable(entries) function	✅ Done	Well implemented
Clear rows before inserting	✅ Done	Inside renderTable()
Centralize row logic	❌ Not yet	newRow() doesn’t accept entry or return a full row — and cell3, row are undefined in other scopes
Remove duplicate JSON.parse()	✅ Done	Good

✅ TL;DR — What’s Left?
🔧 Refactor newRow() into addRow(entry)
js
Copy
Edit
function addRow(entry) {
  const row = transactionTable.insertRow(-1);
  ...
  row.style.backgroundColor = entryTypeColorMap[entry[2]] || "white";
}
Then call addRow(entry) inside renderTable() and forEach().

🧠 Optional Enhancements (Next-Level Polish)
Feature	Purpose
Success message after adding entry	UX feedback
Handle empty filters	"No results found" UI
Validate numbers	Prevent non-numeric input
Add edit/delete buttons per row	Interactivity
Extract localStorage logic	Cleaner state management
